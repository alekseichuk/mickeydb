# MickeyDB [PREVIEW]

With MickeyDB you can use a Sqlite like language to define and generate core Android database components to access and query your database.

MickeyDB generates implementations of SqliteOpenHelper, ContentProvider and a Contract class to help you access your data.

Additionally MickeyDB generates active record classes for each of your tables and views which allows you to access your data, in a strongly-typed way if you choose to do so.

Finally MickeyDB also generates useful ContentValues builders and also provides a useful fluent query API to make content provider queries a snap.

## Quick Start

You can start creating your database by adding a migration.

**src/takeaways1.mickey**
```none
database com.justeat.data.TakeawayDB

migrate initial {
	create table takeaways (_id integer primary key, name text);
}
```

Then later you might want to upgrade it

**src/takaways2.mickey**
```
database com.justeat.data.TakeawayDB

migrate add_cuisines from initial {
  alter table takeaways add column cuisine text;
}
```

You need to add a file ending in init.mickey to satisfy the mickey assembler, for now we just need to define the database name.

**src/takeaways.init.mickey**
```none
database com.justeat.data.TakeawayDB
```

Note: the ``mickey`` files should be in an ``src`` folder by default from your root folder (you can change this in the gradle build file that follows).

With our mickey files we can use a gradle script to generate our code.

**build.gradle**
```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
      mavenCentral()
  }
  
  dependencies {
    classpath "org.xtext:xtext-gradle-plugin:0.1.1"
  }
}

apply plugin: "org.xtext.xtext"

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
    }
}
  
dependencies {
  xtextTooling 'com.justeat.mickeydb:com.justeat.mickeydb:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
 
xtext {
  version = '2.7.3'
  sources {
    srcDir 'src'
  }
  
  languages{
    mickey {
      setup = 'com.justeat.mickeydb.MickeyLangStandaloneSetup'
      output.dir = 'build/mickey'
    }
  }
}
```

Run ```gradle assemble```, code should be generated into the ```build/mickey``` output folder as specified in the gradle build file.
